# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

***Overview of the analysis:***

bobby is looking into making a report to find out who will be retiring in next few years for a positive succession plan and replacement recruitment plans.
 he want to find out how many positions will be available in next few years in order to be ahead of the game.
 The database department have some data, but a detailed analysis will make it solid to be prepared in advance. so, it will be a huge achievement to get this organized for the company. To help Bobby prepare for his analysis, we helped him using pgadmind , SQL.
Choose the SQL, I think was a very good option as The SQL data is persistent and cannot be overwritten if the same command is run again. Once a table has been committed to a database, it is there until a different command is run to delete it. This helps preserve the integrity of the data already in place. Imagine adding a second Departments table with different data that overwrites the existing table.

***Results :***

Driven Analysis led us to find out the best options are to anticipate the most important parts of the head count retirement that could impact the performance of the Pewlett Hackard will be :
•	Mentorship Eligibility table for current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

The Number of retiring employees by title .
The Unique retiring Titles .
